cgrd-glimp-ratchet
=======================

Ratchet version of Glimp prototype application.

Two index files: one with a list of name + thumbnails, the other (index-slider.html) with an image slideshow.

The latter is somewhat broken: ontouchstart and onclick don't play nice together. Won't fix at this point; it's not the point of this exercise to make this prototype work flawlessly.
